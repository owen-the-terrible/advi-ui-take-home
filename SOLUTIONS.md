## Libraries / Frameworks
- React
- react-router-dom  
- Tailwind CSS
I'd chosen these things to build an optomized front end application with Modern styling/UI and easily accessible routes.

## Design Choices
I chose first to use Tailwind to optomize the styling process, as well as to limit the amount of files in the project. I chose to use a Dark theme to be easy on the readers eyes and have a more modern look. The large grid pattern behind the separate articles is supposed to give a good view of what is available and as well as plenty of surface area to click in order to get the contents of the article. This application is fully mobile responsive with a designated mobile menu as well.

## Changes
If I were to do things differently, I would include a log in service, I would replace the url used to do the API calls with an environment variable, and I would find a new API source. Using the newsAPI you can not access the API once deployed, so I would do some research on what would be the best API source to meet my needs on a free version, or I would purchase a membership. The API key IS exposed in this project being a completely free tier and already being publicly available. Given any other circumstance this key would be utilized properly as an environment variable. I think this app would sit very nicely with memberships and a full Login service for users being able to personalize things depending on the user.
